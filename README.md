# ü©∫ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Overview
This project predicts heart disease using machine learning models based on patient medical records. The primary goal is to develop a predictive system that helps in the early detection of heart disease, potentially assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosis and risk assessment.

We implemented and compared two machine learning models:
- **Na√Øve Bayes** (Probabilistic Classifier)
- **Random Forest** (Ensemble Decision Trees)

## üìä Dataset Description
The dataset consists of several patient health parameters, including age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and heart rate, among others.

| Column Name      | Description |
|-----------------|------------|
| **Age**         | Patient's age (in years) |
| **Sex**         | Gender (`M` = Male, `F` = Female) |
| **ChestPainType** | Type of chest pain: `ATA` (Atypical Angina), `NAP` (Non-Anginal Pain), `ASY` (Asymptomatic) |
| **RestingBP**   | Resting blood pressure (mmHg) |
| **Cholesterol** | Serum cholesterol (mg/dL) |
| **FastingBS**   | Fasting blood sugar (`1` = >120 mg/dL, `0` = Normal) |
| **RestingECG**  | Resting ECG results: `Normal`, `ST` (ST-T wave abnormality), `LVH` (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) |
| **MaxHR**       | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| **ExerciseAngina** | Exercise-induced angina (`Y` = Yes, `N` = No) |
| **Oldpeak**     | ST depression induced by exercise |
| **ST_Slope**    | Slope of the ST segment: `Up`, `Flat`, or `Down` |
| **HeartDisease** | Target variable (`1` = Heart Disease, `0` = No Heart Disease) |

## üß† Machine Learning Models
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Na√Øve Bayes
- Probabilistic classifier based on **Bayes‚Äô theorem**
- Assumes feature independence
- Performs well with small datasets

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Random Forest
- Ensemble method with multiple decision trees
- Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy
- Handles both numerical and categorical features

---

## üöÄ Model Performance
The models were evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

| Model           | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|----------------|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Na√Øve Bayes** | 85%     | 83%       | 81%    | 82%     |
| **Random Forest** | **92%** | **90%**   | **89%** | **89%** |

### Observations:
‚úÖ **Na√Øve Bayes** performed well but assumes feature independence, which may not always hold.  
‚úÖ **Random Forest** achieved **higher accuracy** by leveraging multiple decision trees.
